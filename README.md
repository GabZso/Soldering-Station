# Soldering-Station
Board and Schematics for Soldering station based on hakko 907 clone. 
Consider there is slight difference in schematic, the buzzer is connected to pin no.D13 of the arduino and the lcd pin connected to the D13th pin is connected to the D11th pin of the arduino. (please change this in the arduino code before uploading OR use the modified code in this repository).
In this layout LCD and Encoder are not on the PCB but are connected using Jumper Connectors which makes the assembling job easier when mounting this circuit into a Project case.
The eagle libraries that I have used for this schematic are also with this files copy them to your eagle library.
THANK YOU.
